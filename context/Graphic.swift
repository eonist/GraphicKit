/**
 * - Important: ⚠️️ You need to set the size of the frame to something, or else the graphics will be clipped. You can get a rect for For Paths and lines by using the native boundingbox methods or custom boundingbox methods
 * - Note: You can set the position by calling: graphic.frame.origin = CGPoint()
 * - Note: We extend CALayerDelegate so that we can get back draw(_ layer, ctx) without resorting to use MTKView, as MTKView doesn't seem to work as a CALAyerDelegate with CALayer out of the box, because we probably need to use CAMetalLayer...and other complexities conserning MetalKit
 * - Note: MetalKit is complicated and not easy to use out of the box. Maybe add it as an experimental branch instead, and experiment with it along side Element
 * - Note: swift 3 update, NSView doesn't implement CALayerDelegate anymore so you have to implement it your self
